## [sin market](#)

The Distributed Gallery is a collective of thinkers and tinkers
engaged in a critical approach toward art markets and artistic
worlds. Disturbed by the overinterpretation of artistic intentions,
the Distributed Gallery defends a more sensitive and authentic
approach of the so-called contemporary art. Moreover, it wishes to
replace in the center of the game the collective anonymous work in
which the figure of the artist evaporates.

## [chaos machine](@/artworks/chaos/index.md)

The chaos machine is the second artwork of the distributed gallery, born during summer 2018. It exists in two copies connected to each other through the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) blockchain. When a banknote is burnt into one of those two copies, it prints a cryptocurrency and randomly shout music in both of the machines. This crypto-jukebox has inaugurated the [Proof of Work](https://www.schinkelpavillon.de/exhibition/curated-by-simon-denny-in-dialogue-with-distributed-gallery-harm-van-den-dorpel-sarah-hamerman-and-sam-hart-kei-kreutler-and-aude-launay/) exhibition, curated by Simon Denny, at the Schinkel Pavillon in Berlin. The second copy has been exhibited at the [Kate Vass](https://www.katevassgalerie.com/news/perfect-amp-priceless-value-systems-on-the-blockchain) gallery, in Zurich, alongside the work of Ai WeiWei & Kevin Abosh. The chaos machine has also been exhibited in Paris during the oct. 2019 FIAC and sold on [auction](https://www.aguttes.com/lot/99453/10842901) at [Drouot](https://www.drouot.com/lots/10842901?actionParam=listLot=lot=99453).

## [ready-made token](@/artworks/rmt/index.md)

The ready-made token is the first artwork of the distributed gallery, created in december 2017. It consists in a one-unit crypto-token sold through an auction on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) blockchain. With this first artwork, the distributed gallery has pushed the logic of appropriation to its limit by elevating a liquid commodity to the status of artwork through the signature of the figurehead of appropriation art: [Richard Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Prince). This artwork has received a lot of attention because of the many controversies and questions it has raised about the relationship between the art world and the art market.
