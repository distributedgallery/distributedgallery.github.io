# ready-made token

{% materials() %}silicium, solidity code, language{% end %}

The ready-made token is a unique - though totally liquid - [ERC20](https://etherscan.io/token/0x067eefe485ec8659e0a4e7fe8b16f474653da244) token sold at auction on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) blockchain. Its name and form - a non-sensitive artwork - draws a continuity with the Dada program: granting a sacredness to a random commodity through the performative gesture of an artist. The ready-made token turns a cryptographic unit of value into an artwork the same way Duchamp elevated a common object to the status of artwork.

The creation of the ready-made token has been a long linguistic and semantic trick questioning the arcane of the contemporary art world and market. Indeed, the ready-made token has been signed under the name of Richard Prince. But no material connection has ever been made between this Richard Prince - the one signing the ready-made token - and the [Richard Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Prince) everyone knows for his appropriation art.

This hazardous mistmatch has drawn a lot of attention towards the ready-made token, showing how tightly the mechanisms of value production in the art worlds are connected to « linguistic games » and attribution logics. The well known american artist Richard Prince ended up trapped in this hominimy game: he got invited to the prestigious [Rare Digital Art Festival](https://raredigitalartfestival.splashthat.com/), in New-York, to introduce the ready-made token.
