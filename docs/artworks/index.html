<p>The chaos machine is the second artwork of the distributed gallery, born during summer 2018. It exists in two copies connected to each other through the <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a> blockchain. When a banknote is burnt into one of those two copies, it prints a cryptocurrency and randomly shout music in both of the machines. This crypto-jukebox has inaugurated the <a href="https://www.schinkelpavillon.de/exhibition/curated-by-simon-denny-in-dialogue-with-distributed-gallery-harm-van-den-dorpel-sarah-hamerman-and-sam-hart-kei-kreutler-and-aude-launay/">Proof of Work</a> exhibition, curated by Simon Denny, at the Schinkel Pavillon in Berlin. The second copy has been exhibited at the <a href="https://www.katevassgalerie.com/news/perfect-amp-priceless-value-systems-on-the-blockchain">Kate Vass</a> gallery, in Zurich, alongside the work of Ai WeiWei &amp; Kevin Abosh. The chaos machine has also been exhibited in Paris during the oct. 2019 FIAC and sold on <a href="https://www.aguttes.com/lot/99453/10842901">auction</a> at <a href="https://www.drouot.com/lots/10842901?actionParam=listLot=lot=99453">Drouot</a>.</p>
<h2 id="ready-made-token"><a href="https://distributedgallery.github.io/artworks/rmt/">ready-made token</a></h2>
<p>The ready-made token is the first artwork of the distributed gallery, created in december 2017. It consists in a one-unit crypto-token sold through an auction on the <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a> blockchain. With this first artwork, the distributed gallery has pushed the logic of appropriation to its limit by elevating a liquid commodity to the status of artwork through the signature of the figurehead of appropriation art: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Prince">Richard Prince</a>. This artwork has received a lot of attention because of the many controversies and questions it has raised about the relationship between the art world and the art market.</p>
