<p>[aside] is a protocol that locks ERC721 tokens on Ethereum and links their liquidity to external events using oracles. It connects the liquidity of digital artworks to real-world phenomena, intertwining their economic lifecycle with global events. These events can be natural (forests, fisheries, earthquakes, storms), astronomical (solar flares, planetary transits), economic (inflation, deflation), financial (stock markets), demographic, or social.</p></p>
<h2 id="one-arm-crypto-bandit"><a href="https://www.distributedgallery.com/artworks/bandit/">one arm crypto bandit</a></h2>
<p>The one arm crypto bandit is the third artwork of the distributed gallery. Each arm action generates a couple of new Ethereum private keys. If it ever happens that any of these private keys is already in used, its fund become immediately available to the user. Like a bandit, this machine therefore attempts to steal currencies through private keys collision.</p>
<h2 id="chaos-machine"><a href="https://www.distributedgallery.com/artworks/chaos/">chaos machine</a></h2>
<p>The chaos machine is the second artwork of the distributed gallery, born during summer 2018. It exists in two copies connected to each other through the Ethereum blockchain. When a banknote is burnt into one of those two copies, it prints a cryptocurrency and randomly shout music in both of the machines. This crypto-jukebox has inaugurated the « Proof of Work » exhibition, curated by Simon Denny, at the Schinkel Pavillon in Berlin. The second copy has been exhibited at the Kate Vass gallery, in Zurich, alongside the work of Ai WeiWei &amp; Kevin Abosh. The chaos machine has also been exhibited in Paris during the oct. 2019 FIAC and sold on auction at Drouot.</p>
<h2 id="ready-made-token"><a href="https://www.distributedgallery.com/artworks/rmt/">ready-made token</a></h2>
<p>The ready-made token is the first artwork of the distributed gallery, created in december 2017. It consists in a one-unit crypto-token sold through an auction on the <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a> blockchain. With this first artwork, the distributed gallery has pushed the logic of appropriation to its limit by elevating a liquid commodity to the status of artwork through the signature of the figurehead of appropriation art: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Prince">Richard Prince</a>. This artwork has received a lot of attention because of the many controversies and questions it has raised about the relationship between the art world and the art market.</p>
